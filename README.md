# Machine Learning Library

This library contains numerous jupyter templates, and python scripts used to create basic machine learning models.

Some cases models are used for in this library:
1. Predicting housing price based on existing dataset
2. Predict stock prices based on historical data
3. Predict future weather based on historical data
4. Classify images using stacked models

Some ML Algorithms found here include:
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- random forest regression
- ridge regression
- k next neighbors
